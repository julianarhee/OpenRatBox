2 Towers:

A: ((4*4) + 2 + 2) * 2 = 40
B: (2*4) * 2 = 16
C: (4*4) * 2 = 32
D: (2*4) * 2 = 16
E: ((2*4) + 2) * 2 = 20
F: (4*4) * 2 = 32
G: 6 * 2 = 12
H: 2 * 2 = 4


(less extra from past orders + 2 for safety margin)
A: 40 - 12 + 2 = 30
B: 16 + 2 = 18
C: 32 + 2 = 34
D: 16 + 2 = 18
E: 20 - 12 + 2 = 10
F: 32 + 2 = 34
G: 12 + 2 = 14
H: 4 + 2 = 6
