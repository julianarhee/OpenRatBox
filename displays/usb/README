To setup the usb display...

1) install display driver: http://www.displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php
2) install touch driver: http://www.touch-base.com/documentation/mimotouchdevice.htm
3) calibrate
4) set as primary display

Notes
------

After proper installation, should have "UPDD Console" and "UPDD Calibrate" programs. Use the Console to choose Display 1 as the touchscreen monitor (primary), then calibrate by clicking correct icon in the Console (use precise pointer to touch the 4 calibration points).

The display driver may not work with 'Standard' rotation of the display. If so, set the rotation to 180, and flip the monitor. Then recalibrate the touch screen.
